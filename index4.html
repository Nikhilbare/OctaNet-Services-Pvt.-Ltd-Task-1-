                Shaniwar Wada is a historical fortification located in Pune, Maharashtra, India. It was built in 1732 by the Peshwa Baji Rao I, who was the prime minister of the Maratha Empire at that time.

            The fortification was originally intended to serve as the residence of the Peshwa rulers, and it was designed to be a seven-story structure made of stone and brick. However, much of the fortification was destroyed by a fire in 1828, and today only the foundations and some of the walls remain.

            Despite its ruined state, Shaniwar Wada remains a popular tourist attraction in Pune, and it is known for its impressive architecture and historical significance. Visitors can explore the ruins of the fortification, which include the remains of several buildings, gates, and gardens.

            There are also several legends associated with Shaniwar Wada, including stories of ghosts and supernatural occurrences. One of the most famous legends is the story of the young Peshwa prince Narayanrao, who was murdered within the walls of the fortification in 1773. According to legend, his ghost still haunts the site to this day.
